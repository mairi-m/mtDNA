# Agent-based models of mtDNA population dynamics
This project is about modelling clonal expansion. It is for the [gold CREST award](https://www.crestawards.org/crest-gold) with [Conor Lawless](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/profile/conorlawless.html) as a mentor.

## Mitochondria
[Mitochondria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrion) are often referred to as 'the powerhouse of the cell'. Mitochondria are a type of sub-unit ([organelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organelle)) within a [cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)) which create energy for a cell using oxygen, fats, sugars and proteins. Mitochondria are also involved in cell death ([apoptosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis)) which is important because cells which divide too many times result in exessive numbers of cells, causing tumors.

Malfunctioning mitochondria can have [negative health effects](https://www.umdf.org/what-is-mitochondrial-disease-2/0) such as fatigue, muscle weakness and neurodegenerative diseases since they are responsible for making the majority of energy in the body.

## Mitochondrial DNA
Cells which have mitochondria ([eukaryotic](https://biologydictionary.net/eukaryotic-cell/)) not only have DNA in the nucleus but have mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in each mitochondrion. mtDNA is significantly smaller than DNA in the nucleus, however, because cells almost always have many mitochondria and a mitochondrion almost always has multiple mtDNA, there is many more copies of mtDNA in a cell than nuclear DNA. mtDNA is circular and more similar to bacterial DNA than linear nuclear DNA.

Mutated mtDNA can cause disease if they cannot carry out their function properly.

## Clonal Expansion
[Clonal expansion](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsob.200061) is when the concentration mtDNA mutations within cells increase. It can happen as humans age or because of mitochondrial disease. Larger amounts of mutated mtDNA can also cause mitochondrial diseases.

## Mitochondrial Disease
Mutated mtDNA molecules can cause disease because they code for many mitochondrial proteins.  If mutant mtDNA species reaches sufficiently high levels in the cell then these proteins will not be produced in sufficient quantities to support cell function. The result is mitochondrial dysfunction. Some primary mitochondrial diseases are [leigh syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_syndrome), [mitochondrial myopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_myopathy) and [Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leber%27s_hereditary_optic_neuropathy). Mitochondrial dysfunction has also been connected to illness such as alzheimers, cancer and muscular dystrophy. Mitochondrial disease can have severe and untreatable consequences such as vision and hearing loss, difficulty walking and breathing, epilepsy, neurodegeneration and developmental defects.

## Modelling mtDNA
It is important to model mtDNA to gain a better understanding of it so treatment for many different mitochondrial diseases can be developed. In this project we will create an agent based model of mtDNA population dynamics in a single cell. The model will show mtDNA being synthesised and degraded.
